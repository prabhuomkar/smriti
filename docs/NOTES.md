# Notes

- [ ] ML models should be agnostic and configurable
- [x] Each action should be configurable from the environment config e.g. Face grouping, Place Identification, File Size Limits
- [x] API-first techniques and then build Web UI & Mobile Apps
- [ ] Demos can include: deployment on Fly, Heroku, other SaaS, hosting on Raspberry Pis and dockerized deployment on Cloud
- [x] Logging to make sure consistency across several components
- [ ] Give a comparison of supported file formats between Google Photos and Pensieve
- [ ] Send email on failures to owner or some metric of daily upload success/failed
- [ ] Release Workflow in GitHub Actions, to deploy Docker images to Docker Hub Registry
- [ ] Infra Cases: graceful shutdown of api & worker, database reconnects & grpc retry/reconnect

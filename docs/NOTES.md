# Notes

- ML models should be agnostic and configurable
- Each action should be configurable from the environment config e.g. Face grouping, Place Identification, File Size Limits
- API-first techniques and then build Web UI & Mobile Apps
- Demos can include: deployment on Fly, Heroku, other SaaS, hosting on Raspberry Pis and dockerized deployment on Cloud
- Logging to make sure consistency across several components

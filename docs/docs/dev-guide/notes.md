# Developer Notes
- [x] ML models should be agnostic and configurable
- [x] Each action should be configurable from the environment config e.g. Face grouping, Place Identification, File Size Limits
- [x] API-first techniques and then build Web UI & Mobile Apps
- [x] Demos can include: deployment on Fly, Heroku, other SaaS, hosting on Raspberry Pis and dockerized deployment on Cloud
- [x] Logging to make sure consistency across several components
- [x] Give a comparison of supported file formats between Google Photos and Smriti
- [x] Send email on failures to owner or some metric of daily upload success/failed
- [x] Release Workflow in GitHub Actions, to deploy Docker images to Docker Hub Registry
- [x] Infra Cases: graceful shutdown of api & worker, database reconnects & grpc retry/reconnect
- [ ] i18n support for languages incrementally: English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, etc.
